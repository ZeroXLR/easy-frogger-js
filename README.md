# A Simplistic Frogger Game

### Description and Objective:

This is a simple variation of the popular Frogger game. In this game, the winning objective is to get the hero/heroine from his/her original position to the water for a refreshing swim. However, you cannot collide with any pesky bugs while going there; if you do, the hero/heroine must go back home for a bath!

### Controls:

The controls are simple. Simply move the hero/heroine with the **up**, **down**, **left** or **right** keys (which have the obvious effects).
